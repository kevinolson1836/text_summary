print("And so as we have dealt with the pandemic, I volunteer for anybody who wanted me to come in and talk a little bit about how to manage a team project in the environment that you're in now where you can't meet and you need to figure out how to work together using technology, which you probably have been doing for years, because you technology and then have been ubiquitous your whole lives.\nAnd so if we're going to ask you to do a team project, we're going ask you to do a team project that you can't just meet face to face and figure it out, then the least we can do is provide you with a little bit of content about how to be high performing teams and what some of those right selections are for the technologies that are available to you for collaboration.\nAll right, so just to to start out, you might have wondered over time why in the world do we have to do team projects in our classes?\nThere might be a little truth in that, right, but in addition to that, teams can outperform individuals.\nTeams don't actually outperform individuals unless they're put together in a way that works.\nOtherwise, you expend all of your effort and and exercise in trying to herd those cats that are in your team and you don't get enough time to work on the task.\nSo in order for teams that perform individuals, we have to manage that.\nCost coordination teams can use employee talents better, but only if the right talents have been put together on a team.\nAnd if we spend some time understanding what each of us are good at and why we might have put in put together on this team and then leveraging those different talents, then the team is going to use employee talents better.\nAnd the point of that is this notion of a follow the Sun team where the team is always on, there's always some member of the team that's up and at work, and that really provides a great deal of responsiveness to the environment.\nWe know that when you leave here, you're not going to be working as an individual most of the time you going to be working as part of a group or a team.\nWe're going to do a team project.\nTeam has to figure out how to be effective.\nAnd so the first thing that can happen in a team that can harm its effectiveness is something that gets called social loafing in the academic literature.\nI put in more effort than I'm working on a team project and they're supposed to be two or three other.\nThere's a lot of effort that says that's in fact what happens when we work on teams.\nWe have lots of things we're trying to accomplish and we may shortchange our team on occasion in order to get our individual work done.\nThe other thing that can cause problems in a team that can impact how the individual effort accumulates into the group effort is something called the ringland effect.\nSo the two things that you have to manage as part of your team, whether it's face to face or or computer mediated, is how are we going to address social loafing and then how are we going to manage coordination cost?\nWhich takes us to kind of the final topic in these slides, and that is that you guys have don't have the options that you would normally where you could be at the same time, same place or traditional team that just says every day after class, we're going to meet for 20 minutes.\nYou're probably not going to experience same same place, different time, which is sort of like job sharing where somebody works in the office for me to do.\nSo what you guys are going to experience in your teams and you're going to want to manage is the synchronous versus asynchronous way that you're going to interact with each other.\nAnd both of those, if you're not going to be in the same place at the same time, make you what gets referred to as a virtual team or computer mediated team, and it just means that technology is bringing together in some way.\nIn fact, probably every team you've ever worked on in your adult life was virtual or computer computer mediated in some way.\nBut the thing to think about as you as you use technology to support your team is there are some things, especially in asynchronous technology, that have to be carefully managed.\nSo some members of your team or morning people and you think you do your best work between midnight and three a.m. doesn't matter because everybody can work when it's most convenient for them.\nAnd that, again, sort of gets at this ball of the sun, almost idea that the team could potentially be working non-stop.\nI'm not advocating that any of you guys need to be twenty four hour teams or suggesting that in order to accomplish your project, you have to do that.\nAll right, so what does it mean to you, you have a semester long project, you probably want to be in a team where everyone contributes.\nAnd so you created a situation now where somebody is going to work on their own stuff because their team doesn't appreciate them.\nWe want everybody to contribute and probably get a decent grade and decent might mean different things to different people in the class.\nHave the team's been formed already?\nSo how do we get to a team that manages social loafing, that addresses the cost of coordination, that gets to exclusivity and the outcomes that they want and a fairly enjoyable experience?\nDoes this team want things done a couple of days early so everybody can look at it?\nBut if we say this team is always going to we're going to each have our own individual assignments for this task and everybody needs to have their done twenty four hours in advance so we can make sure things work together so we can look at each other's work and we can turn in the best product possible.\nYour team should decide.\nAnd the reason that's important is there's lots of research out there that says when we don't see each other, an email or some form of electronic communication is our primary means of interacting with our team.\nThose are very different outcomes in terms of how the team forms and how effective we work together.\nSo having a shared understanding of how we respond to communication and that includes maybe I think everybody should respond within 15 seconds because I'm constantly monitoring social media, but other people don't write.\nBut when conflict isn't handled right, that good TASC conflict escalates into really bad social conflict and team members stop liking each other.\nAnd I just want to remind you guys, though, for this for this team contract, you're required to communicate only through the Reginette forums.\nYou're going to be wild and free to meet in any way that you want to zoom whatever other community computer mediated communication to you would like to use it for this first team contract.\nSo the reason that we're doing this and asking you just is a asynchronous medium to do this is there's lots of research about teams that says if we meet face to face or via zoom or something right off the bat, there are some biases that can form that are related to just how we might look different or act different on the surface and that teams can be higher performing, especially computer media teams could be higher performing faster by sharing some ideas.\nAnd then again, after the first challenge the team project, you'll you'll decide to use some common combination of asynchronous and synchronous that I'll come back to this and talk about when the first I'm going to give you step two for being a high performing, inclusive team, and that is to rotate roles.\nYour team should assign roles so everybody knows what's expected of them for any deliverables.\nSo this leader reflects that was developed before many of your board has been sighted a lot of times is that any leader in a team rotates through all eight of these roles, different points in time in a team project.\nAnd my own work on student teams using technology to interact on a semester project so that as you guys found, that the highest performing teams exhibited individual producer behavior, individual task leadership, which meant everybody to be responsible for those things that were assigned to them and getting it done.\nAnd then shared monitoring means everybody is keeping an eye on what everybody else on the team is supposed to be producing, see if they need help, checking in with them, looking at a product before it gets submitted.\nThese are the rules we're asking you to define in your team a team lead in each phase, so the leader clearly communicates, assign tasks and evaluates individual performance.")
